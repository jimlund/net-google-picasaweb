=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is where you will find information about the photos, videos, and thumbnails themselves. You can get information about them with this object, such as the URL that can be used to download the media file. This object (and its children) also provide some features to fetching this information.

=head1 ATTRIBUTE

=head2 title

This is the title of the photo or video.

=cut

has title => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'Str',
);

=head2 description

This is a description for the photo or video.

=cut

has description => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'Str',
);

=head2 content

This is the main photo or video item attached to the media information entry. See L</MEDIA CONTENT> below for information about the object returned.

=cut

has content => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'Net::Google::PicasaWeb::Media::Content',
);

=head2 thumbnails

This is an array of object containing information about the thumbnails that were attached when the photo was retrieved from the server.  See L</THUMBNAILS> below for information about these objects.

=cut

has thumbnails => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'ArrayRef[Net::Google::PicasaWeb::Media::Thumbnail]',
    auto_deref => 1,
);

=head1 METHODS

=head2 from_feed

Builds a media class from a service object and reference to a C<< <media:group> >> object in L<XML::Twig::Elt>.
